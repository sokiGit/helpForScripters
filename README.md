*Repository description:*
> This is a repository where I put answers to bugs in code that I come over. You're free to copy code you find in here and use it in your own code, but please don't copy this and say it's yours. Thanks &lt;3


*Information:*
> In this repository there are multiple folders and subfolders with their respective names. For example In `sokiGit/helpForScripters/bugs/html` will be a bug with body height not being 100vh.

> At every bug I will explain how it can occur, what is it causing and how to fix it.

> All of these answers can be found on [Grepper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grepper/amaaokahonnfjjemodnpmeenfpnnbkco?hl=en). My profile is [here](https://www.codegrepper.com/profile/soki).

> Grepper answers can be found faster but will not be explained. If you wan't to know how to avoid these bugs, I recommend looking into this repository.
